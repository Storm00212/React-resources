 * App.tsx - React Router Application Entry Point
 *
 * This component serves as the main entry point for the React Router demonstration.
 * Currently, it only displays a simple "hello world" message, but in a full
 * React Router application, this would contain the router configuration and
 * route definitions.
 *
 * Note: This appears to be a placeholder implementation. A complete React Router
 * setup would include BrowserRouter, Routes, Route components, and navigation.
