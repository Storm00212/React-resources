/**
 * Home.tsx - Home Page Component for React Router
 *
 * This component represents the Home/Landing page in a React Router application.
 * It would typically be rendered when users visit the root path "/" or "/home".
 * The component displays welcome content and company information.
 *
 * In a React Router setup, this would be associated with a Route component
 * and would serve as the default page users see when they first visit the site.
